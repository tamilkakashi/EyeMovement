# EyeMovement
Overview
This project features a playful animation of eyes that follow the mouse cursor movement on the screen. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it creates an engaging visual effect that reacts dynamically to user interactions.

Features
Interactive Eye Animation: Two animated eyes that follow the mouse cursor as it moves across the screen.
Responsive Design: The animation adjusts based on the browser window size and user position.
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run the HTML file.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
CSS File: Ensure the eye-style.css file is included in the project directory for styling.
Open the HTML File: Open index.html (or whatever you've named it) in a web browser.
Interact with the Animation: Move your mouse around the screen to see the eyes follow the cursor.
Code Structure
HTML:

Contains the basic structure, including a div for the eyes and the animated elements.
CSS:

The eye-style.css file (not included here) should style the eyes and the balls to create the desired visual effect.
JavaScript:

Uses document.onmousemove to track mouse movements and update the position of the eyeball elements dynamically.
Customization
Eye Styles: Modify the eye-style.css file to change the appearance of the eyes and their pupils (e.g., size, color).
Mouse Follow Sensitivity: Adjust the calculations in the JavaScript to change how closely the balls follow the cursor.
